    Pa11y can't catch all accessibility errors. It'll catch many of them, but you should do manual checking as well.

    Only distinct <?php echo $context->options['standard'] ?> errors are being reported.  To locate and fix errors on your page, <a href="http://squizlabs.github.io/HTML_CodeSniffer/">install the code sniffer bookmarklet</a> and run it on your page.
