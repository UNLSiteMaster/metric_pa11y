This error means that a form exists on the page, but it does not have a submit button.  Using a button to submit a form is important because it ensures that users do not become confused by an unexplained change of context arising from an input change in a form.


The following example is **not valid** because it does not have a submit button:

```
<form>
   <label>
       First Name
       <input type="text" name="first_name" />
   </label>
</form>
```

The following is valid

```
<form>
   <label>
       First Name
       <input type="text" name="first_name" />
   </label>
   
   <input type="submit">
</form>
```
